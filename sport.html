        <p>Welcome to Smart Girl. Thank you so much for visiting our site. 
            We are an information website designed to help women better understand 
            the sea of controversy in today's world. A lot of the facts on our site 
            are heavy because some of the topics are heavy. So take a couple of deep, 
            cleansing breaths and with an open mind, dig in.  Most importantly, remember 
            that you are valued and loved. The world needs you, smart girl! </p>
